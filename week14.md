For this week I researched the article "Multilingual Analysis and Visualization of Bibliographic Metadata and Texts With the AVOBMAT Research Tool".
This introduces the AVOBMAT (Analysis and Visualization of Bibliographic Metadata and Texts) tool, which was designed to enable researchers to analyze bibliographic data and texts using Natural Language Processing techniques. 
I wanted to do this paper to get a more in depth look into natural language procesing visualizations.
AVOBMAT's scalable infrastructure allows for processing and enriching large volumes of texts and metadata in multiple languages. 
Through bibliographic data and NLP methods, it offers both close and distant reading capabilities in a user-friendly web application.
There were a lot of visualizations presented in this article, including a word cloud, connection graph, chart comparison, and well made tab based applications.
Their tool is great for all sorts of analysis of documents, being a nice catch all, that is very user friendly, making use of bolding and coloring to exaggerate aspects of the app.
It's interesting to see how well visualizations can apply to the NLP field, and I'd love to use this tool myself.
