For this week I took a look into stocks, and how to best visualize them.
This paper I found looked into different forms of stock visualizations, and gave an overview on why they're used.
It also dealt with visualiziation problems, such as in the case of visualizing multiple stocks with substantially different values.
Most stock charts have time as the x value, viewing historical values.
A candlestick chart is used for visualizing different aspects of stocks in a single line, using color to further represent data. (But this one is pretty hard to comprehend).
This paper shows the value of mathematics to alter the data, implementing log scores and comparative values.
I learned a lot about what's typically used for stock visualizations, and what trends are good for selling and buying, which is great to see.
I hope visualizations like this will continue to improve to enhance understanding of the industry.
