The paper I did this week was "Interactive Visualization of Weather and Ship Data" delves into the development of a tool named Ship and Weather Information Monitoring (SWIM), which integrates weather data with information from ship voyages.
Their visualization is an application that displays weather info alongside ship moving patterns.
By providing real-time insights, SWIM facilitates informed decision-making regarding route selection and navigating potential hazards.
The research also involved a qualitative usability study to uncover any usability issues and gather user feedback for future enhancements. 
Overall, the findings were positive, with users expressing confidence in the tool's ability to streamline their daily operations. 
This study highlights how important effective visualizations are in tasks, with user friendlly experiences aiding marine takes significantly.
The weather map uses color effectively to show problematic areas, and combines multiple visualization types to display a lot of information at once.
It's great to see how people can do so much with so little space in their visualizations.
