The paper I did this week was titled "Big Data Visualization Tools: A Survey".
As the title suggests, this paper goes into the history of big data and popular visualization techniques used for big data.
I read this paper to learn more about the field of big data.
There are three dimensions of the data to consider in this field for characterization: velocity, variety, and volume.
With an increase in each dimension, it's found to be harder to create visualizations.
You can distuinguish different types of visualizations in the field, such as information related ones (InfoVis), and scientific spatial layout ones (SciVis).
This paper analyzes popular data visualizations in multiple categories, such as scope and software category.
This paper gives a good high level overview of all these tools, but doesn't go too in depth with them, which is weird due to the whole surveying aspect the paper was doing.
If I want to continue onwards with this topic, I should look more into the individual visualization tools and what they can accomplish.
